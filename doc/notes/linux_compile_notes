Note about compiling under some Linux systems

It turns out that some versions of the gcc linker behaves a little different from each other.

In the handout makefile the linked libraries is specified after code to compile.

All the required libraries, GLM, Freeglut, glew and boost are all available on the ubuntu store for easy installation.  

on line 61:
$(APP): $(OBJECTS)
	$(LD) -o $(APP) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS)

switching it around to worked on ubuntu running in a virtual machine:
$(APP): $(OBJECTS)
	$(LD) -o $(APP) $(OBJECTS) $(LDFLAGS)

If you wish to compile in a virtual machine, you might have to change the a few lines of code in the examples to get them to compile at a lower OpenGL context (my WMware fusion virtual machine only supports OpenGL 2.1 when running ubuntu)

change or remove these lines
glutInitContextVersion(3, 1);
â€¦
if(!GLEW_VERSION_2_1) {
  std::cerr << "Driver does not support OpenGL 3.1" << std::endl;  
  return 1;
}
Note that this might not work with every exercise/oblig as they might require functionality from OpenGL 2.1+
